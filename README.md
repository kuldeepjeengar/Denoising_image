# Denoising_image
This GitHub project demonstrates a noise reduction solution employing an Autoencoder. Trained on a dataset of noisy images, the Autoencoder preserves essential features while removing noise. It includes code, dataset, and model weights. Visual comparisons and evaluations highlight its effectiveness in restoring clean images from noisy inputs.
